          I am currently a full time student, attending University of California, Riverside. I'm interested in anything
          Computer Science, although I'm currently taking an interest in web development, using React, Next.js, MongoDB,
          as well as Flutter, Dart, and Firebase. As such, full stack web dev is the career path I'm currently aiming
          for.

          My interests include rock climbing and playing music. As a rock climber, I mostly boulder around v5 indoors,
          although I'm really looking forward to climbing more outdoors. The instruments I play are piano, marimba,
          electric guitar and electric bass
